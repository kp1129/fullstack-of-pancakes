           <p><span role="img" aria-label="cactus">üåµ</span> I'm based in the sunny Phoenix, Arizona, and I build full stack apps.</p>
           <br/>
           <p> My favorite part of the stack is frontend (<span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">‚ú®</span>React, Redux, CSS, LESS/SASS, Bootstrap, Material UI, styled-components, etc) but I'm just as comfortable diving into backend (<span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">‚ú®</span>Node, Python), deploying (<span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">‚ú®</span>Heroku, Vercel, Netlify), and am learning mobile dev (<span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">‚ú®</span>Flutter).</p>
           <br/>
           <p>My path into tech was a bit nontraditional. Like many college students, all I knew for sure was that I wanted to help people. I picked psychology as my major because, frankly, humans are fascinating. I thought I could fulfill my desire to help people by becoming a therapist. I soon realized that helping people was only part of the puzzle; what I really wanted to do was to research the things we still barely understand and to do something about all the unanswered questions...<span role="img" aria-label="face with monocle">üßê</span></p>
           <br/>
           <p>My desire to explore and innovate brought me to work at Y Combinator startups. There, I helped grow superstar teams that were truly building the future! I caught the programming bug instantly. <span role="img" aria-label="laptop">üíª</span>I began taking computer science and programming classes in my free time, and soon I was on my way to Lambda School, a year-long code bootcamp that teaches full stack JavaScript development, computer science fundamentals, and includes a hackathon-style internship.</p>
           <br/>
           <p>Outside of writing code, I like to travel and I read a ton of books. <span role="img" aria-label="stack of books">üìö</span>My record so far is 116 books in one year (it was a crazy year). I'm interested in exploring the unknown, pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and helping people by building the tech of the future.</p>
