        My favorite part of the stack is frontend (
        <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
          ✨
        </span>
        React, Redux, CSS, LESS/SASS, Bootstrap, Material UI, styled-components,
        etc) but I'm just as comfortable diving into backend (
        <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
          ✨
        </span>
        Node, Python), deploying (
        <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
          ✨
        </span>
        Heroku, Vercel, Netlify), and am currently learning mobile dev on the
        side (
        <span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">
          ✨
        </span>
        Flutter).
