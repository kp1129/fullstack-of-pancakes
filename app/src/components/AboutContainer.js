           <br/>
           <p>Hi! My name is Katya and I'm a fullstack engineer based in the sunny Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
           <br/>
           <p>During my college years I did research in psychology, and a few years after graduation I attended Lambda School, which is a computer science academy that trains fullstack developers through a mastery-based progression program.</p>
           <br/>
           <p>Between college and Lambda School, I worked at several San Francisco-based startups in an operations/HR capacity. I interviewed software engineers and helped grow superstar teams that got to build the coolest stuff! This is what got me interested in software engineering in the first place, and what keeps me excited to this day.</p>
           <br/>
           <p>Outside of work, you can find me reading a book or working on a personal code project at a local coffeeshop.</p>
